# Enhanced Privacy

{/* <Callout type="info">
  If strict GDPR/CCPA compliance is not important to you, leave this option disabled as it makes some parts of the analytics less accurate.

Rybbit stores user IDs as a hashed combination of IP + user agent. Doing this allows us to identify users across many sessions on the same device, but can be seen as storing personally identifiable data under GDPR.

You can enable enhanced privacy by going to the settings page of your website dashboard and enabling the "User ID Salting" option.

When you turn this one, Rybbit will forget about unique users every day. If a user visits your site 10 times in one day, Rybbit will count that as one user with 10 sessions. But if he visits once a day for 10 days, he will be seen as a new user every day.

### Downsides of enabling user ID salting:

- You will no longer see user session history beyond 24 hours.
- Unique user count over a period longer than 24 hours will be inflated.
- The user retention page will effectively be useless.
